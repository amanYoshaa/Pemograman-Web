		<p>High Grade (HG) is a line of Gunpla kits by Bandai. These kits feature better range of motion and greater poseability than most No-Grade kits. It is important to note that 1/100 scale models for Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, Mobile Suit Gundam 00, and Mobile Suit Gundam IRON-BLOODED ORPHANS do not have HG listed anywhere on the box or manual, but they are considered comparable to High Grade in terms of quality.</p>

		<h1>Real Grade</h1>

		<p>Real Grade (RG) (リアルグレード Riarugurēdo?) is a line of Gunpla kits that was introduced by Bandai in 2010 as part of the Gundam 30th Anniversary commemoration project. These consist of Mobile Suits from both the Universal Century and the Alternate Centuries. The RG line combines the best aspects of the other three Gunpla lines: The small size and affordable prices of the High Grade, the advanced inner frame technology of the Master Grade and the massive parts count and details of the Perfect Grade. The tagline for the RG line is "Excitement Embodied".[1] Also, the RG line reflects what a mobile suit would look like if it were built in the present day.

			The RG line is known for the Advanced MS Joint, using a dual-molding technique with both ABS and PP plastics. Initially, the inner frame of RG suits were placed on a single gate for easy construction, along with hands with poseable fingers. More recently, however, the inner frames of RG kits became more dependent on hand-built inner frames made of PS or ABS plastic. Advanced MS Joint frames from here are instead are more limited and used to construct parts of the kit that are more impractical to assemble. Additionally, hands with poseable digits ceased to be included with these kits, them instead containing a wider range of fixed hands. Kits in the below list with these more limited frames have additional details regarding their function.
			
			Following the reorganization of Bandai Namco Group, box covers of reissue and future release of kits from September 2018 onward feature blue Bandai logo instead of the original red logo.
			
			Starting in 2020, the Real Grade line expanded beyond the Gundam franchise with mecha from Rebuild of Evangelion and The King of Braves GaoGaiGar. From here onward, the Real Grade logo was modified to exclude "144", even though the Gundam releases are still predominantly 1/144 scale.
			
			Starting in 2022, the Real Grade logo was moved from the top right corner of the box art to above the model's name to make room for the Bandai Namco logo on both reissued kits and new releases.</p>

		<h1>Master Grade</h1>

		<p>Master Grade (MG) (マスターグレード Masutā Gurēdo?) is a line of 1/100 scale Gunpla kits of the Mobile Suits in the Gundam meta series. The series was first produced in 1995 as part of the Gundam 15th Anniversary project.[1]

			Master Grade kits differ from other 1/100 scale Gunpla, with their level of detail, articulation, and proportions being second only to the Perfect Grade line. A majority of MG kits feature a skeletal inner frame with working hydraulics, some also accommodate Gunpla LED Units for light-up gimmicks. To give viewers a perspective of the Mobile Suit's size, many MG kits come with 1/100 scale figurines of the pilots or key characters of their respective series. In addition, some kits include 1/20 scale character figures.
			
			Beginning in 2002, veteran mecha designer Hajime Katoki began redesigning various Mobile Suits and releasing them in the Master Grade line under the label of "Ver.Ka" (Version Katoki). Some of the Ver.Ka kits were produced as a result of annual fan votes. In addition, many Mobile Suits from the Universal Century and Cosmic Era timelines have received redesigns under the monikers "Ver.1.5", "Ver.2.0", "Ver.3.0", and "Ver.RM".
			
			In 2020, Bandai created a new sub-line Master Grade Extreme (MGEX),[2] which features "Extreme Points", additional gimmicks that exaggerate key points of the featured Gundam using custom lighting units, a completely gold washed inner frame or other methods to strongly highlight the uniqueness of the Gundam. The sub-line also has its own Ver.Ka kits, with the first in the line being a Ver Ka.</p>

		<img src="unleashed.jpg" width=35%>
		<p>Perfect Grade (PG) (パーフェクトグレード Pāfekuto Gurēdo?) a line of 1/60 scale Gunpla kits of the Mobile Suits in the Gundam meta series. The PG line originated with the release of the Perfect Grade Evangelion EVA-01 in 1997. The line was then exclusive to the Gundam franchise from 1998 to 2017, until Bandai announced the Perfect Grade 1/72 scale Millennium Falcon for the Star Wars franchise. The PG line has significant external and internal details plus light up gimmicks with LEDs. The PGs are some of the most expensive Gunpla produced and have often been used to develop Master Grade and Real Grade technology.

			In 2020, Bandai introduced a new sub-line Perfect Grade Unleashed to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Gunpla, featuring kits with increased complexity and diecast metal parts.
			
			Following the reorganization of Bandai Namco Group, box covers of reissue and future release of kits from September 2018 onwards feature a blue Bandai logo instead of the original red logo, while releases and reissues from mid-2022 onwards further feature the Bandai Namco logo on the upper left or upper right corner.</p>

		<p>Gundam Plastic models, Gundam Plamo, or Gunpla (ガンプラ, Ganpura) are model kits depicting the mecha machinery and characters of the fictional Gundam multiverse by Bandai.

			These kits became popular among mecha anime fans and model enthusiasts in Japan and nearby Asian countries beginning in the 1980s. Gundam modeling spread in the 1990s with North America and Europe being exposed to Gundam through television and manga.
			
			The name Gunpla derives from an abbreviation of "Gundam plastic model" phrase, since most kits are made of plastic.
			
			Bandai sold over 100 million Gundam plastic model units between 1980 and 1984, and over 300 million units by May 1999. By 2015, Bandai had sold an estimated 450 million units worldwide across nearly 2,000 different Gundam models. As of March 2021, Bandai Namco has sold 714.84 million Gundam plastic model units, including 538.24 million standard Gundam units (since 1980) and 176.6 million SD Gundam units (since 1987).</p>

		<p>Gundam (Japanese: ガンダムシリーズ, Hepburn: Gandamu Shirīzu, lit. Gundam Series) is a Japanese military science fiction media franchise. Created by Yoshiyuki Tomino and Sunrise (now Bandai Namco Filmworks), the franchise features giant robots, or mecha, with the name "Gundam". The franchise began on April 7, 1979, with Mobile Suit Gundam, a TV series that defined the "real robot" mecha anime genre by featuring giant robots called mobile suits (including the original titular mecha) in a militaristic setting. The popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a franchise that includes 50 TV series, films and OVAs as well as manga, novels and video games, along with a whole industry of plastic model kits known as Gunpla which makes up 90 percent of the Japanese character plastic-model market.

			Academics in Japan have viewed the series as inspiration; in 2008, the virtual Gundam Academy was planned as the first academic institution based on an animated TV series.
			
			As of March 2020, the franchise is fully owned by Bandai Namco Holdings through subsidiaries Sotsu and Sunrise. The Gundam franchise had grossed over $5 billion in retail sales by 2000. By 2022, the annual revenue of the Gundam franchise reached ¥101.7 billion per year, ¥44.2 billion of which was retail sales of toys and hobby items.</p>

		<p>Yoshiyuki Tomino (富野 由悠季, Tomino Yoshiyuki, born 富野 喜幸; November 5, 1941) is a Japanese anime director, screenwriter, songwriter and novelist best known for creating the Gundam anime franchise. Tomino began his career in 1963 with Osamu Tezuka's company, Mushi Productions, scripting the storyboards and screenplay of the first Japanese television anime, Tetsuwan Atom (also known as Astro Boy). He later became one of the most important members of the anime studio Sunrise, going on to direct numerous anime through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Tomino is perhaps best known for his transformation of the super robot genre into the real robot genre with 1979's Mobile Suit Gundam. He has also won numerous awards, including the Best Director award at the recent 2006 Tokyo International Anime Fair (for the 2005 film Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam: Heirs To The Stars). Tomino often writes lyrics for the various songs featured in his series under the pseudonym Rin Iogi (井荻麟 Iogi Rin?). Tomino (as Iogi) has collaborated with artists such as Yoko Kanno, Asei Kobayashi, MIO and Neil Sedaka.</p>
